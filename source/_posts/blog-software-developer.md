This is my third blogging software, and I'm happy (for now :) to say I'm back on WordPress. Why? In short, I don't want to tinker anymore with my blog software.

If you're reading this close to the publish date, you'll notice this blog is bland. In fact, this is the stock Wordpress theme. The only customizations are removing some UI to make it more minimal and clean. And the only plugin I installed is [WP-Markdown](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/) for writing.

My previous blog software, [Anchor CMS](http://anchorcms.com), was great. Clean, minimal look and feel with markdown support. But it is a young platform and I had to tweak several things to get it the way I wanted. Further, it was missing a couple of features that I just couldn't get around to working on. These days I can't prioritize the time to things like this. And I choose to get my software development kicks from projects I find more interesting.

I wanted something were I could completely focus on writing and not have to worry about anything else. WordPress was not on my mind at all, but after investigating the countless other options, I decided on it. I feel confident that there will always be a plugin for whatever I need. And if I really need to, adding a hack here or there shouldn't take too much time.

<s>For nostalgia, I've moved my two previous blogs to here and here.</s>

Slowly, I'd like to personalize the site and make it more "me", but for now I want to focus on writing more and I think making this move will help.
