Don't be this guy! I've been noticing that there's a far more effective way to influence potential buyers. In this short post, I explain how you can sell without explicitly selling.

I just came back from a networking event put on by a really great grass-roots tech community. And it was hosted by a massively huge software and technology company. The ones who changed our lives in '95\. I was really looking forward to it thinking I'd learn a lot. But aside from the before and after networking, it was largely a waste of time.

Why? Almost every speaker was from this big tech company or another big company, and they were all explicitly selling. There were boring. The only one who wasn't boring was a last-minute fill in, a business owner, who told us real stories about his business adventures. Who the heck still actually sells in this day and age?

If I want to purchase something, there is endless information from real people who don't have anything to gain from sharing their knowledge about almost every product/service on the planet. Why would want to listen to a subjective pitch?

If you want to sell something then **stop selling and start educating**. People who educate provide instant value, they build trust, and demonstrate skill, knowledge and experience. And by the way, they also offer a product or service? What the heck? Well, what do they sell?

Not only am I reading their marketing material, I'm doing it voluntarily. I'm sure this is old news for everyone, but I was really surprised to see speakers from such big companies doing old-school sales pitches up there to mostly a younger, tech, and startup oriented crowd. I guess old habits die hard...
