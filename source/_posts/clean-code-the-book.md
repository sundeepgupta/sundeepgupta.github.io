Initial insights after reading the first bit of Clean Code, the book written by Robert C. Martin aka Uncle Bob.

<!--more-->

I started reading the book called [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert C. Martin. I've been told and have read that this is a must read for aspiring developers. So far from what I gather, the book is all about **writing code for easy maintenance.**

I love this because, this is how I live my life. When I have financial papers mailed to me, they get filed right away because I know that I'll need to find them one day and I don't want to run around my house wasting half a day looking for them. So I'm really excited about learning all that Martin has to say because I want my code to be elegant.

But wait, there's more! Martin also says **writing clean code saves time _now_**. But how can all the constant refactoring speed things up when your have deadlines to meet? Isn't it faster to clean the code later, say all in one day, after the deadline? Apparently not because you'll need to return to your code several times in the short term, and if its not clean, you'll lose time trying to understand/remember what you were trying to do. I kind of agree, but I need to prove this to myself to be fully convinced. It'll certainly take a leap of faith when the deadline is looming over your head.

Can't wait to keep reading...
