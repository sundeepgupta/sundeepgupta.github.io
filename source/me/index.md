I'm an iOS Software Craftsman living in Toronto, Canada who likes expanding my horizons technically and personally. I work at [Influitive](http://influitive.com) and do some mentoring at [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca). I'm enjoying life with my wife and two daughters. I like getting to know new people and love talking about software development.

Happy exploring!
