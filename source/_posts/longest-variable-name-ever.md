Is this the longest variable name ever?

<!--more-->

I found this while working on a client project. The client uses an eCommerce software (which I won't name here), and while debugging an issue, I ran into this bad boy:

I know self-documenting code is good, and sometimes that involves long names, but this is ridiculous. It is obvious there are deeper issues at hand here. As you can see, there are three logical inferences built into this single boolean variable with words "Is", "ButHasNo" and "Yet". Not to mention a host of other information.

I hope I never run into anything longer than this.
