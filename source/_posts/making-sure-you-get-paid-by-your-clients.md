Through my experiences running a business and freelancing, I've accumulated some best practices to help protect me from non-paying clients.

#### Disclaimer

I’m not a lawyer. This post is me sharing best practices from my own personal experiences. You should consult your lawyer if you need legal advice.

## Background

You could call this a complimentary post to [Mike Monteiro’s "F*ck You, Pay Me" talk](http://vimeo.com/22053820). This post is complimentary because here I describe many concrete things I learned to do to protect myself from clients who don’t pay. The following is about choosing the right clients, terms to consider for your contract, and practical tips on engaging and working with your client. I’m not suggesting you need to follow everything I write about here. Do what makes sense for your situation.

### Not getting paid really sucks

Part of the motivation to write about this is because when you don’t get paid, it really sucks, especially when you freelance. You personally and directly do the work and you put your heart into it. A lot of times, you become friends with your client, intended or not. So when they stop paying you, it can really burn. Lets not forget that it affects your financial life which puts strain on you and your family.

## Work with the right clients

When you work with the right clients, you’re less likely to have payment issues in the first place. Client selection is worth at least a blog post or probably a book on its own. Not only is it important from a payment risk perspective, but also extremely important for your business as a whole.

This might be obvious, but its worth outlining the rationale here. If you work with the right client, you’ll be solving a problem for the client, thus you’ll be making/saving your client money. If you have the right client, you’ll be in control of the project which means you'll perform at your best. All of these things add up to your client being _happy_ to pay you. Obviously this isn’t a guarantee, but its your first big step in minimizing your payment risk (and helping grow your business).

Selecting the right client is one of the hardest things to do. One book that helped me gain more clarity on this subject is [The Win Without Pitching Manifesto by Blair Enns](https://www.winwithoutpitching.com).

### Questions for clients

From a money point of view, if you’re interested in reducing payment risk, you can get a pretty good picture of the risk you’ll be taking by digging a bit deeper into the client. Here are some questions that you may want answered when prospecting:

*   How long have they been in business? The longer, the more of a reputation they'll want to uphold.
*   How viable is there cash flow? Do they make sales? What are their cash sources? Startups obviously are more risky, especially if they are dependent only on investment cash.*   What is the project? Is it meant to go into production or is it experimental? How valuable is it to the client? Basically, how worthy is the project? If the project doesn't add value to their business, they won't care as much or worse may abondon it after it starts.*   How large is the project? Does it fit the business/people? If the project is really big, it might be too ambitious for them, and can quickly fall apart. People are much less motivated to pay into a failed project.

Keeping these questions in mind will help you evaluate the riskiness of the client, project and their ability to pay you.

## The contract

If you’re asking yourself, if you need a contract as a freelancer, the answer is a big “YES”. I recommend watching [Mike Monteiro’s talk](http://vimeo.com/22053820) if you have this question or aren't fully convinced.

Once you’ve found the right client, you'll both want to be crystal clear on the project, but also the money stuff too. Describing money issues in the contract is absolutely necessary in order to protect yourself. This is the _only thing_ that you'll have to stand on if your financial relationship goes sour because it’s the only thing the courts will care about.

> Once you’ve decided to work with a client, the contract is the only thing that can protect you from non-payment.

More importantly, however, is that formally agreeing to these terms sets up clear expectations in the client’s mind as to what their responsibilities are. If you have the contract right, getting paid will be a lot easier.

### Contract terms

What kind of terms do I need in the contract? The quick and dirty answer is: everything that’s important to you. I never really knew what was important to me until I had more experience, especially after a client didn't pay.

There are several resources online with contract templates including [The Freelancers Union Contract Creator](https://www.freelancersunion.org/contract-creator/). It’s likely that they won’t include everything that’s important to you, so here are the things that I considered for my own contracts based on my experiences:

*   Collect a deposit to kick things off. And get it via cheque so you can capture their bank info. Bank info is helpful in case you need to sue and garnish their bank account. On a practical level, a deposit shows the client has some cash, and is serious about working with you.
*   Specify pricing like billing rates and quotes.
*   Describe how and when you should be paid. For example, every week within 7 days of the invoice date via bank transfer. This is very important. I never used to put this here, and then I’d always be playing catch-up with the client. Putting this stuff in the contract is the difference between asking for payment and reminding them about payment.*   Specify that if payment is not made according to the terms above, that the code/work/software remains your property. Further, that the code/work will not be given to the client. This gives you practical leverage.*   How subcontractors are dealt with. This may not be important to you, but for some larger projects I hired my own subcontractors. Spell it out in the contract if you need this flexibility and what the policy will be. One thing worth considering is protecting yourself from the client “stealing” away your subcontractor or visa-versa. By the way, having a contract with your subcontractor is something you should also have.*   All code, software and work remains your property until fully paid for.
*   If your client is a corporation, that means the people signing the contract aren’t actually personally responsible for paying. They may be Mr. or Ms. Moneybags, but if their corporation doesn’t pay you, tough luck. To avoid this, situation, add a personal guarantee into the contract that ensures if the corporation doesn’t pay, the people will.

I should also mention that it is completely acceptable to put terms on your invoice template as well, so again, if it's important, go ahead and do it.

### Who’s contract?

Its not really a question of yours or theirs, because it is a shared thing. The contract binds both of you. Obviously it’s easier to use your own because it’ll already have the terms important to you. If this is not possible though, you’ll need to do more work and ensure all the terms you want are in there. You'll also have to comb through the client's terms to make sure they are reasonable. In this case, you may want to consider a lawyer's expertise to help with any hardcore legal stuff.

## Practical tips to keep the cash flowing

Based on my experience, and depending on your situation, here are some more best practices I’ve learned along the way.

### Get paid upfront

If you can, do it. End of story. I haven't actually tried this but a friend does this with some of his clients so I know its reasonable to to do. The client would pay you in advance for a set amount of billable time, say two weeks. Then you’d work for two weeks and stop until the client pays again. Obviously, this is an ideal situation and really does nip the problem in the bud. The drawbacks are that it may be used as negotiating leverage for the other terms of the engagement, like your rate for example. And I would imagine it's harder to find clients willing to do this.

### Control the code

Maybe the best thing I've learned is to use your own code repository. One that the client cannot access. This is not always possible, but if it is, it's worth the extra overhead. It’s a free, built-in protective measure to use as leverage against non-payment. If they don’t pay, they know they won’t get the code.

### Due diligence

When I hear this term I think of a corporate takeover, but what I’m trying to say here check the facts. Is the company who they say they are? Is the person you’re dealing with legitimately employed there? Do they have signing authority? Is their address correct? This is good to do because it'll tell you if they lied about anything and how their business is setup. You'll need to know this for when the contract is made. There are companies that do this in case it makes sense for you to outsource it.

#### Credit checks

When your client pays _after_ you do the work, you're really extending credit to them. Part of your due diligence process might be to do a formal credit check. Internet searching will bring you lots of reading on this aspect but at a high level, it involves collecting their bank info, names, addresses, credit references, and permission to contact these people to verify their credit worthiness. Part of that process can involve getting a credit report from [Dunn &amp; Bradstreet](http://www.dnb.com) or similar corporate reporting agency.

### Be transparent

You’re probably already transparent about your work on the project and it should be the same about money issues. I learned this the hard way and screwed up exiting a project because I wasn’t transparent about the client’s payment issues. It ended up with a bunch of money lost.

What I learned is I should simply communicate payment issues plainly. Its a touchy subject, so use discretion and judgement but do not be afraid to bring it up. Be clear and direct about it. Your confidence about money will make them feel better about you, not worse. If they’re starting to be late on payments, let them know that payments need to be made according to what you agreed to. Its hard, but if you can learn how to do this, you'll be a better freelancer for it and lose less money.

## Wrap up

Doing software development work for people is truly a joy. Its a shame that some clients just don't or can't pay for the heart and soul we put into solving their problems. I hope this can serve as a guide for making sure you get paid by your clients.

Happy exploring!
