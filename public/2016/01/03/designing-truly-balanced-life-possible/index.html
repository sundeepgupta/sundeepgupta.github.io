<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>Today is my last day of a three week “staycation” (a vacation where I stay at home). I have a young family so essentially, it’s been the same life, except for going to work. Considering I work full-time, this was a lot of time for me to figure out what I’d do exactly, and I was getting a bit anxious as my staycation was approaching.</p>
<p>But two days before, luckily (or unluckily), I hurt my back due to sleeping on the floor due to attempting to heal my shoulder. I learned that doing this can cause a shift in the spine and my chiropractor woke me up saying I needed to take better care of my body. It was gnawing at me all year that I need into better physical shape as I’ve become inactive save for my short bike rides on my commute.</p>
<p>Reflecting beyond my physical health, I wasn’t feeling the greatest mentally or socially either. My mind has been distracted, and I’ve been losing touch with family and friends. I also didn’t have any hobbies. I knew I needed to make changes. This is how I mostly spent my staycation - this and getting plenty of sleep of course.</p>
<p>I’ve resolved to make several changes in the various areas in my life. And I was able to put a lot into practice during my staycation, but it’s easy when I’m not working. I’m skeptical as to how I will accomplish this once I get back into the swing of work. I fear of getting too busy and and de-prioritizing the good habits I’m trying to establish. This post is an attempt to address the skepticism I feel and to explore what an ideally ideally designed life might look like.</p>
<h2 id="My-ideal-life’s-activities"><a href="#My-ideal-life’s-activities" class="headerlink" title="My ideal life’s activities"></a>My ideal life’s activities</h2><p>I’ve broken things down into activities I’d like to do on a weekly basis in alphabetical order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Body</strong> - Take care of my shell. If i’m not physically healthy, my quality of life suffers and I might be prevented from doing work or spending time with family and friends.<em>   <strong>Chores</strong> - All the necessary admin type work you need to do. Laundry, pay bills, all the boring stuff that you can’t ignore.</em>   <strong>Commuting</strong> - Unfortunately, this is a big part for a lot of us. If your commute is short, that is seriously amazing.<em>   <strong>Family</strong> - For me, this generally means my kids (I have spouse as a category lower down). Parenting and building a relationship with my kids is very important to me, after all, after we die, all we have is what we’ve taught the younger generations.</em>   <strong>Getting ready</strong> - Showering, dressing, breakfast. Winding down at night - stretching, reading, etc. For me and any parent, this includes helping the kids too.<em>   <strong>Hobbies</strong> - Self explanatory, but I believe it’s important for me to distinguish this from Personal because this is an active thing I want to do. For example, learn the guitar. Where as Personal time could be completely passive, like watching your favourite TV show. For you this may not be true for you, but one of my goals is to develop a hobby as I never really had one before.</em>   <strong>Mind</strong> - Mind training, spirituality, philosophy, religion, etc. I group all of this stuff together. Personally, it is mind training and exploration through meditation.</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong> - As mentioned above, this is your own personal down time. Just relaxing, down time. Reading, listening to music, watching a movie, etc. Stuff that doesn’t require energy.<em>   <strong>Sleep</strong> - Self explanatory. If you don’t sleep well, your entire system breaks down. This is something I definitely want to get better at.</em>   <strong>Friends</strong> - Developing and deepening relationships with friends.<em>   <strong>Spouse</strong> - I call this out separately probably because I found that once we had our girls, our relationship suffered. And we’ve made it a priority to strengthen it. To do this, we need to consciously work on it. It is far too easy to not do this as our days are filled with stuff to do. For example, putting date nights in our calendars.</em>   <strong>Work</strong> - This is about earning income to pay bills. This is also the time where you do any career advancement things such as reading, networking, courses, conferences, Meetups, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I estimated how much of each activity (except for work) I’d ideally like to spend doing on a weekly basis. Work’s time was calculated at the end as the time left after all other activities were accounted for. <em>Note:</em> Take these numbers with a grain of salt. A lot of this is personal preference and guesswork. Your ideal activities and allocations will likely differ quite a bit.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YXm702N.png" alt="Weekly activities"></p>
<h2 id="Insights"><a href="#Insights" class="headerlink" title="Insights"></a>Insights</h2><h3 id="Work"><a href="#Work" class="headerlink" title="Work"></a>Work</h3><p>Work is the only thing worth discussing at this point. Sure, we could say I don’t need that much family time and so on, but let’s just assume my numbers are correct for the discussion. What we’re seeing then is that we work too much. What? I love what I do, so that can’t be right. In Western culture, work weeks generally start at 40 hours and increase the higher up in the organization you are and how small the business is. I truly enjoy building software, so this feels like a bummer. But maybe it’s not. Maybe I would be a better crafter and I’d enjoy it more if I did it less.</p>
<p>The other, more practical, issue is that if I only got paid for 25 hours a week, it would pose a financial problem. So where do we go from here? How do we resolve the differences? What does this say about our Western culture? (I’ll skip this last question as it’s out of scope, but interesting, nevertheless).</p>
<h2 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h2><p>This is where our design skills come in. How can we realistically design our ideal life given that we’ve identified all of the things we want to do, and yet, maintain our current income level? I see two solutions. Work for myself, or combine activities wherever possible. (Or both).</p>
<h3 id="Work-for-myself-freelance"><a href="#Work-for-myself-freelance" class="headerlink" title="Work for myself (freelance)"></a>Work for myself (freelance)</h3><p>To maintain income levels, it is probably not possible to do this in a short amount of time at your day job. That leaves working for myself. And working for yourself can mean two different things: Building a business, or freelancing. And building a software development business is not a realistic option as the number of hours required is generally more than any full-time job in the first place. So, that leaves us with freelancing.</p>
<p>With freelancing, to address the financial concern, it comes down to billable hours multiplied by your rate. (I won’t get into value based pricing, for the sake of simplicity). I’d be trying to maximize my billable time, meaning I’d want to minimize effort in getting clients, things like marketing, sales, etc. This would mean I’d need an amazing reputation with a great network. Then, depending on how many billable hours you could work, you could set your rate to match your current income. As an example, supposed I was able to bill 15 hours a week and my current income was $100k. If I worked 48 weeks in a year, I could set my rate to be about $140/hour.</p>
<p>The possibly more concerning aspect of this is that as a freelance developer, it may not be realistic to find clients that are ok with with 15 hours (or whatever that number is) a week. Generally speaking, clients have timelines they must meet, and they want a lot of work done quickly. My billable capacity might be too little. Where as for someone like a chiropractor, where clients only need them for 1 hour each week, it could work out nicely.</p>
<h3 id="Combine-activities"><a href="#Combine-activities" class="headerlink" title="Combine activities"></a>Combine activities</h3><p>If the 25 hour work week sounds like the land of unreasonable, the other way is to combine activities. For example, I could get fit and socialize at the same time by going for a jog together with a friend. The caveat here is that doing this may not always yield the same result as having them done separately. And obviously not all activities are could be combined - like work.</p>
<p>The question is, can enough activities be combined to make your ideal activities fit together with your full work week? If you work 40 hours a week, that’s combining 15 hours worth of activities. It sounds reasonable, but I’d guess it would take a good amount of effort, and will require compromises. For example, ditching the car for public transportation so you can read during your commute, or travelling to a different gym to meet a friend.</p>
<h2 id="Making-the-changes"><a href="#Making-the-changes" class="headerlink" title="Making the changes"></a>Making the changes</h2><p>So there it is… the ideal lifestyle and two ways to achieve it. Why does it seem so hard? True holistic health requires time. More time than our culture has carved out for us. I have my work cut out for me. As I go back to work tomorrow morning, integrating these lifestyle changes will require a lot of combining of activities. Lets see where I come out.</p>
<p>Happy exploring!</p>
