Finding your purpose is hard. A failed business took a lot out of me, but it gave me much more strength in clarifying my life's purpose.

â€• Gautama Buddha

After pouring a lot of time, effort and money into a business called SalesCase, I recently decided to stop the project.

In the beginning, it seemed all too simple to build and sell. However, after almost a year of research, planning, developing, marketing, networking, etc., it seemed like I was still only half way there before getting an MVP to market! How could this be? It was supposed to a simple software.

I know it sounds bad, and its hard to accept. But I learned a lot about software development and starting a software business. But more importantly, I made great strides in finding my purpose.

When I look back on all of the work I did for SalesCase, research, planning, wireframing, marketing and networking, I remember I was the most excited when I clicked on the Xcode icon and it started to bounce. Because in those moments, I knew, I would soon be coding again.
